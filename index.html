				<h2>General</h2>
				<p>
					Hello, and Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Ilya Pivavaruk, and I am an undergraduate
					student at University of Nevada Las Vegas. I am pursuing a B.S. in computer science, and 
					I plan to graduate in May of 2022.
				</p>
				<p>
					When I am not working on homework or projects, I have a few personal hobbies.
					I love jamming out on my guitars (both acoustic and electric), playing video games,
					and hanging out with friends (when there isn't a pandemic happening).
				</p>
				<h2>Experience Overview</h2>
				<p>
					I started working with computer hardware from the age of 7. 
					I began with helping my uncle fulfill custom computer orders for his customers. By the age of 15 I began playing around with video
					game development. I taught my self C# and worked with the Unity engine. I later picked 
					up Unreal Engine which forced me to learn C++. In freshman year of high school, I learned a language
					called AutoIt which allowed me to create desktop bots to automate different tasks. Throught my
					Junior and Senior year in high school, I took several computer science classes and further learned
					C++, Web Development, and Python. Currently I am a Senior at University of Nevada Las Vegas. I have taken several CS classes where I learned about 
					algorithms, data structure, computer hardware, and programming. Currently I work as an Augmented Reality engineer and a researcher
					at UNLV. This job has taught me a lot about software development and software development practices that I believe will greatly benefit
					me when I start my career as a Software Developer.<br><br>
