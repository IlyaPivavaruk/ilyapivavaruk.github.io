				<h2>General</h2>
				<p>
					Hello, and Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Ilya Pivavaruk and I am an undergraduate
					student at University of Nevada Las Vegas. I am pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science and 
					I plan to graduate in May of 2022. Due to my outstanding grades in High School I have had 
					the opportunity to not only pursue a Computer Science degree but also join UNLV's Honors 
					Program.
				</p>
				<p>
					When I am not working on homework or projects I have a few personal hobbies.
					I love jamming out on my guitars (both acoustic and electric), playing video games,
					and hanging out with friends (when there isn't a pandemic happening).
				</p>
				<h2>Experience Overview</h2>
				<p>
					I started working with computer hardware from the age of 7 when I still lived in a country called Belarus. 
					I was helping my uncle fulfill custom computer orders for his customers. By the age of 15 I began playing around with video
					game development. I self taught my self C# and worked with the Unity engine. I later picked 
					up Unreal engine which forced me to learn C++. Freshman year of High school I learned a language
					called AutoIt which allowed me to create desktop bots to automate different tasks. Throught my
					Junior and Senior year in high school I took several computer science classes and further learned
					C++, Web Development and Python. After High School I went straight into University to pursue a Computer
					Science degree. Currently I am a Junior and have taken several CS classes where I learned about 
					algorithms, data structure, computer hardware, and programming. I have been working at Code Central
					as a Programming Instructor where I help students learn and accomplish different programming/robotic 
					projects. I have also had the opportunity to be a Technical Advisor for Scary Robot during one
					of their video game releases.<br><br>
