				<h2>General</h2>
				<p>
					Hello, and Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Ilya Pivavaruk, and I graduated in May of 2022 from the University 
					of Nevada Las Vegas with a B.S. in computer science.
				</p>
				<p>
					When I am not working on projects, I have a few personal hobbies. 
					I love jamming out on my guitars (both acoustic and electric), playing video games, working on my car and hanging out with friends.
				</p>
				<h2>Experience Overview</h2>
				<p>
					I started working with computer hardware at the age of 7. I began by helping my uncle fulfill custom computer orders for his customers. 
					By the age of 15, I began playing around with video game development. I taught myself C# and worked with the Unity engine. 
					I later picked up Unreal Engine which forced me to learn C++. In my freshman year of high school, I learned a language called AutoIt 
					which allowed me to create desktop bots to automate different tasks. Throughout my Junior and Senior year in high school, I took several 
					computer science classes and further learned C++, Web Development, and Python. Currently, I am a Senior at the University of Nevada Las Vegas. 
					I have taken several CS classes where I learned about algorithms, data structures, computer hardware, and programming. My senior year at UNLV, 
					I worked as an Augmented Reality engineer and a researcher at UNLV. This job has taught me a lot about software development and practices that 
					I believe will greatly benefit me when I start my career as a Software Developer.<br><br>
