		<h1>RC Boat</h1>
		<div class="main">
			<h2>Summary</h2>
			<p>
				After winning a Raspberry PI in a class Programming Competition I decided to make good use of it. At the time I was learning Python programming language 
				and I wanted to learn about networking. This was my project which combined my knowledge of Programming and Circuit Design.<br></br>

			<h2>Logistics</h2>
			<p>
				The boat itself was a bit of a hassle to put together. For the main body, I used a plastic cookie box which did not provide enough buoyancy with the raspberry pi in it. 
				I had to use 2 empty water bottles to help keep the boat up. I used 2 wooden steaks that I cross-binded to hold the 2 plastic bottles and just taped the whole 
				bottom portion to the main body. The 2 DC motors are held by a piece of card board. I wrapped it in tape to make sure the cardboard wouldn't become wet. 
				
				Since the Raspberry Pi doesn't give off constant voltage off of its pins I had to use a motor controller with an additional power supply. This helped with the 
				distribution of voltage to the 2 motors on the boat. The Raspberry Pi just had to give off enough voltage to enable or disable the motor controller. 
				I wired the motors so that they could be engaged both in the clockwise and counterclockwise direction. This makes turning more responsive.
				
				I used python as the programming language for this project. I had to program 2 different applications. The receiver application is located and ran on the Raspberry Pi 
				and a Transmitter application is located and ran on my laptop. The transmitter application waits for user key input and once a key is pressed a message is sent over Wi-Fi 
				to the receiver. The reciever then activates whatever pins are needed to execute an action (such as forwards, backward, left, and right).
			</p>
			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>
				I always wanted to learn about networking and this was a fun way to introduce myself to it. I like projects that are fun and teach me something. 
				This was one of those projects because I was able to see the boat working right in front of me as I was making different changes in the code.
