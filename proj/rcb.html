		<h1>RC Boat</h1>
		<div class="main">
			<h2>Summary</h2>
			<p>
				After winning a Raspberry PI in a class Programming Competition I decided to make a good use of it. At the time I was learning Python programming language and I wanted to learn
				about networking. This was my project which combined my knowledge of Programming and Circuit Design<br></br>
			</p>
			<h2>Logistics</h2>
			<p>
				The boat it self was a bit of a hassle to put together. For the main body I used a plastic cookie box which did not provide enough boyancy with the raspberry pi in it. I had to use 2
				empty water bottles to help keep the boat up. I used 2 wooden steaks that I cross binded to hold the 2 plastic bottles and just taped the whole bottom portion to the main body. The 2
				DC motors are held by a piece of cart board. I wrapped it in tape to make sure the cardboard wouldn't become wet. 
				
				Since the Raspberry Pi dosent give off constant volage off of its pins I had to use a motor controller with an additional power supply. This helped with the distribution of volate to the
				2 motors on the boat. The Raspberry Pi just had to give off enough volate to enable or disable the motor controller. I wired the motors so that they could be engaged both in the clockwise
				and counter clockwise direction. This makes turning more responsive.
				
				I used python as the programming language for this project. I had to program 2 different applications. The reciever application which is loacted and ran on the Raspberry Pi and a Transmitter
				application which is located and ran on my laptop. The transmitter application waits for user key input and once a key is pressed a message is sent over wifi to the reviever. Reciever then
				activates watever pins are needed to execute an action (such as forwards, backwards, left, and right).
			</p>
			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>
				I always wanted to learn about networking and this was a fun way to introduce my self to it. I really like projects that are fun and teach me something. This was one of those projects
				because I was able to actually see the boat working right in front of me as I was making different changes in the code.
