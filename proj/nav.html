		<h1>Augmented Reality Indoor Navigation</h1>
		<div class="main">
			<h2>Summary</h2>
			<p>
				I have been working on researching and building an indoor navigation application for both iOS and Andorid phones. This project has been
				a great learning experience and has taught me a lot when it comes to working on large projects.
				Below is a video that shows me navigating from one room to another, start of the video is censored to keep any names hidden due to privacy concerns.

			<h2>Logistics</h2>
			<p>
				I used Unity with AR Foundation plugins to create the application. This whole project is split into 3 parts. The application it self, a helper application
				which is used for development of virtual maps, and the server side which does optical character recognition. The application it self is responsible for spawning
				in an appropriately alligned virtual map which will be placed on top of the real world build's hallways. The application is also responsible for calculating
				the shortest (best) path to the destiantion that is selected by the user. It spawns in the pathway highlighted by green arrows which dynamically allign to 
				the user's walking pattern and offset. The helper application is used on the development side. A developer launches the application and walks around a buidling,
				a 3D wireframe will be created which can then be used to create a virtual map of the building. The server communicates with the main application, it's purpose
				is to help locate the user in the real world going off of a scan of a nameplate that is present near each room in the buildings I was working with. Once the server
				receives an image it will perform optical character recognition operations and return location identifying string to the application. 
			</p>
			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>
				This project was a great learning experience for me and I am proud of what I accomplished. I not only strengthened by programming skills but also
				learned to take creative approaches to obstacles that occur when developing an augmented reality based application.
